| personality                                                    | Brutal Honesty: She can be quite blunt to her friends to the point that she comes across as rude. Cannot Keep a Secret: Especially when it comes to Monica's secrets. Beware the Silly Ones: She may seem like a sweet Granola Girl with a kooky sense of humor, but she was tough enough to mug older boys when she was just a teen living on the street.
